# COVID-19 Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-ray Images

## Overview

This project aims to develop a model to predict the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia in chest X-ray images. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze X-ray images to identify patterns indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia, contributing to timely diagnosis and treatment.

## Purpose

The primary objectives of this project include:

- **Detecting COVID-19 Pneumonia**: Building a model to accurately predict the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia in chest X-ray images.
- **Analyzing Findings**: Investigating the prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia in specific regions of the chest, particularly focusing on basilar and peripheral areas.
- **Evaluating Model Performance**: Assessing how well the model performs across different datasets.

## Methodology

For this project, we utilized **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** as our final model. The model was tested across two different test sets, yielding the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Approximately 73%
- **Recall**: Approximately 90%
- **F1 Score**: Approximately 75%

### Key Findings

- The analysis indicated that COVID-19 pneumonia may be more prevalent in the basilar and peripheral regions of the chest.
- Model performance varied significantly across different datasets, suggesting challenges in generalization.
